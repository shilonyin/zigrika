### Logging in
Depending on the version the private server currently targets, you may need to get the client from a third-party (if it's a BETA) OR get the client from Kuro's official launcher (or steam) (if it's LIVE).

Next, you have to apply the necessary [client patch](https://git.xeondev.com/WavyRooms/helios). Follow the instructions from the patch's README.
